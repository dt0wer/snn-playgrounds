#  SNNPlayground
A minimal, reproducible Swift project that implements a single spiking neuron using the Izhikevich model, with clean code, clear parameters, and a lightweight SwiftPM “app playground” for fast iteration. This repo accompanies the first article in a series turning a personal SNN sandbox into a structured, public exploration.
